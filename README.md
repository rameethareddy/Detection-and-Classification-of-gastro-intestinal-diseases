# Detection-and-Classification-of-gastro-intestinal-diseases
A CNN-SVM framework is proposed for early detection and classification of gastrointestinal diseases using endoscopic images. The CNN extracts key features, which are classified by SVM, achieving effective and accurate diagnosis to improve patient outcomes.

# Kvasir Dataset
The Kvasir dataset is a publicly available collection of labeled endoscopic images of the gastrointestinal tract, used for research in automated disease detection. It contains multiple GI disease categories such as polyps, ulcers, and inflammations, but also poses challenges like class imbalance and varying image quality. The dataset is widely used to train and evaluate machine learning and deep learning models (e.g., CNN, SVM) for improving early diagnosis in medical image analysis.
